# Changelog

All notable changes to QK4 will be documented in this file.
This changelog is auto-generated from [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) at release time.


## [0.4.0-beta.3] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **audio**: Add jitter buffer for RX audio playback
  - Decoded PCM was written directly to QAudioSink, so any network jitter
  - caused buffer underruns heard as crackle/pop artifacts. Add a small
  - packet queue with a 10ms feed timer and ~40ms prebuffer (2 Opus packets)
  - to absorb jitter before draining to the audio device.
  - Rename playAudio() to enqueueAudio() — packets queued, not written directly
  - feedAudioDevice() drains queue on 10ms timer, respecting sink bytesFree()
  - Prebuffering holds playback until 2 packets accumulate
  - Overflow cap at 50 packets (~1s) drops oldest to bound memory
  - stop() clears queue and resets prebuffer for clean reconnect

  - Prebuffering holds playback until 2 packets accumulate
  - Overflow cap at 50 packets (~1s) drops oldest to bound memory
  - stop() clears queue and resets prebuffer for clean reconnect

### Fixed

- **audio**: Reduce jitter prebuffer to 1 packet (~20ms)
  - 2-packet prebuffer introduced noticeable audio-visual desync — meters
  - and waterfall updated instantly while audio lagged ~40ms behind.
  - Reduce to 1 packet for tighter sync while still decoupling the write
  - path from the event loop.
- **state**: Use sentinel defaults for 17 RadioState fields to ensure initial signal emission
  - When connecting to a K4 in USB mode, the modeChanged signal was suppressed
  - because m_mode was already initialized to USB. The change guard (if old != new)
  - silently dropped the first update, leaving the side panel showing CW controls
  - instead of voice controls. Same pattern affected 16 other fields (tuning step,
  - filter bandwidth/position, antenna, ATU, message bank, audio mix, balance).
  - Changed all 17 fields to sentinel values (-1, Unknown, -99) that can never
  - match real K4 state, guaranteeing the first RDY dump value always triggers
  - the signal. Added Unknown case to modeToString() returning empty string.

---

## [0.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **audio**: Add stereo output, MX routing, SUB mute, and BL balance
  - Change audio engine from mono to stereo Float32 output (L=Main, R=Sub)
  - Parse MX command (RX Audio Mix) for all 10 routing modes that map
  - main/sub to L/R output channels when SUB RX is on (menu 105)
  - SUB RX off now produces true silence on sub channel — sub slider
  - has zero effect when sub receiver is disabled
  - BL balance applies as final L/R gain after MX routing, works
  - regardless of SUB RX state (per K4 manual)
  - Wire subRxEnabledChanged to mute/unmute sub audio channel
  - Wire audioMixChanged and balanceChanged to OpusDecoder
  - Fix BAL overlay: restore full-size button, move MAIN/SUB labels to
  - bottom, remove grey background artifacts on value rows

### Fixed

- **ui**: Wire REV button with press/release pattern (SW160/SW161)
  - REV is a momentary button — press sends SW160 to temporarily move
  - VFO B frequency to VFO A, release sends SW161 to restore.
  - Replaced clicked signal with pressed/released signal pair.
- **ui**: Popups follow app window to secondary monitor
  - Replace QApplication::primaryScreen() with referenceWidget->screen()
  - in all 8 popup positioning functions. Popups now clamp to whichever
  - screen the app window is on instead of always snapping to primary.

---

## [0.3.0-beta.5] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **ui**: Add WheelAccumulator for trackpad scroll handling, fix PWR init bug
  - Replace per-widget angleDelta rounding with shared WheelAccumulator that
  - accumulates fractional trackpad deltas into discrete steps across all 16
  - wheel-enabled widgets. Enable trackpad momentum for panadapter frequency
  - tuning (flick-to-tune). Fix PWR display showing "--" on connect when
  - radio is at 50W QRO due to m_rfPower default matching radio state.

---

## [0.3.0-beta.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **kpod**: Use hid_open_path() on all platforms and ship udev rule for Pi
  - hid_open() fails on Linux with "hid_error is not implemented yet" because
  - the hidraw backend requires permissions that non-root users don't have.
  - Switch to hid_open_path() on all platforms (was Windows-only) so the exact
  - device found during enumeration is opened. Add retry logic for all platforms.
  - Keep the Windows hid_open() VID/PID fallback for stale device path handling.
  - Ship a udev rule (99-kpod.rules) in the Pi bundle and auto-install it on
  - first launch via run.sh.
- **kpod**: Prevent libusb mutex crash on Linux by managing hidapi lifecycle
  - On Linux (libusb backend), calling hid_exit() in checkDevicePresence()
  - destroys the libusb context while a device handle is open from openDevice(),
  - causing a pthread_mutex_destroy assertion failure and crash.

---

## [0.3.0-beta.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **ci**: Fix Pi cache save by fixing Docker root ownership
  - Docker writes apt and ccache files as root. The actions/cache step
  - runs as the runner user and fails to tar root-owned files. Add
  - sudo chown after docker run to transfer ownership before cache save.
- **ci**: Switch Windows to Ninja for sccache and warm caches on main
  - sccache was silently ignored on Windows because CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
  - only works with single-config generators. Switch to Ninja (with MSVC dev
  - env setup) so sccache can intercept cl.exe invocations.
  - Also add push-to-main triggers on all three standalone build workflows so
  - dependency caches are saved on the main ref, allowing tag-scoped release
  - builds to restore them via restore-keys prefixes.

---

## [0.3.0-beta.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **pi**: Clean up bundle with strict library checks and remove dead plugins
  - Replace silent || true on all library copies with require_lib/optional_lib
  - helpers that fail the build immediately when a required library is missing.
  - Remove multimedia plugins (GStreamer backend) that can't load without
  - unbundled dependencies — the audio engine uses QAudioSink/QAudioSource
  - directly through PulseAudio/ALSA. Set QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb in the launcher
  - since we only ship XCB plugins. Add a post-copy verification step that
  - validates all critical libraries landed in the bundle before packaging.
- **pi**: Pass release version into Pi build for consistent versioning
  - Accept version as first argument in build-pi.sh and pass it to CMake
  - as K4CONTROLLER_VERSION_FULL. Update the release workflow to extract
  - the tag version and forward it to the Pi build, matching how macOS
  - and Windows builds already receive the version string.
- **ci**: Add dependency caching across all platforms
- **pi**: Use cp -rL in bundle helpers to handle directories
  - The optional_lib and require_lib helpers used cp -L which fails on
  - directories like xcbglintegrations. Use cp -rL so both files and
  - directories are handled correctly.
- **pi**: Expand libpulsecommon glob before passing to cp
  - require_lib quotes its arguments which prevents wildcard expansion.
  - Resolve the libpulsecommon-*.so glob with ls first, then copy the
  - resolved path.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.24] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **ci**: Speed up release builds with sccache upgrade and parallel compilation
  - Upgrade sccache-action v0.0.7 → v0.0.9 to fix 0% cache hit rate caused
  - by GitHub cache service v2 migration. Add sccache to macOS builds, enable
  - parallel compilation via CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL, and pin vcpkg to the
  - runner image version to prevent cache invalidation from git pull.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.23] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **pi**: Bundle libpulsecommon to fix PulseAudio version mismatch
  - The Pi build bundles libpulse.so.0 from Debian Trixie (PulseAudio 17)
  - but was missing its private dependency libpulsecommon-17.0.so. On
  - Bookworm-based Pi OS, only libpulsecommon-16.x exists, causing a
  - runtime load failure.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.22] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Remove KPA1500, Network, and DX Cluster tabs from Options dialog
  - These features aren't ready for public use. The underlying infrastructure
  - (KPA1500Client, KPA1500Window, RadioSettings keys) remains intact for
  - re-adding later.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.20] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Make Qt6 GuiPrivate optional on Linux for cross-compilation
  - Debian cross-compilation may not ship Qt6GuiPrivateConfig.cmake.
  - Use the same graceful fallback as Windows — try to find it, fall
  - back to manual include paths if not available.
- **ci**: Link Homebrew packages after cache restore, GuiPrivate fallback
  - Add brew link --overwrite after install to fix cached-but-unlinked
  - packages causing cmake to fail finding Qt6
  - Make Qt6 GuiPrivate optional on Linux for cross-compilation
- **ci**: Remove Homebrew Cellar cache that breaks macOS builds
  - Caching /opt/homebrew/Cellar/* without the /opt/homebrew/opt/*
  - symlinks causes brew install to see packages as "already installed
  - but not linked", leaving Qt undiscoverable by cmake.

### Revert

- Remove broken Homebrew optimizations from macOS CI
  - Revert HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE, brew link, and ccache additions
  - that broke macOS builds. The Cellar cache + NO_AUTO_UPDATE caused
  - brew to skip relinking, leaving Qt undiscoverable by cmake.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.19] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Update lint CI and remove dead CLAUDE.md references
  - Remove clang-format version pin in CI (use system default)
  - Add development branch to lint CI triggers
  - Remove all dead CLAUDE.md references from docs

---

## [0.2.0-beta.18] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Honor K4 "Mouse L/R Button QSY" menu setting
  - Discover menu item ID dynamically via MEDF on connect
  - Track live changes via menuValueChanged signal
  - "Left Only" mode: disable right-click/drag on both panadapters
  - "L=A R=B" mode: left always tunes VFO A, right always tunes VFO B

### Fixed

- Restore correct PC (power) command parsing for L/H modes
  - The handlePC() function was incorrectly rewritten during the refactor in
  - 4b704c3. Original code correctly checked L/H suffix, but refactored version
  - assumed 00/01 format causing QRO power to be divided by 10 (50W → 5W).
  - L mode (QRP): nnn = watts × 10, divide by 10 to get watts
  - H mode (QRO): nnn = watts directly, use as-is
  - X mode (XVTR): skip for now
- **ui**: Use font metrics for cross-platform button text positioning
  - Switch all custom-painted widgets from setPointSize() to setPixelSize()
  - to fix cramped text on Windows (96 PPI vs macOS 72 PPI). Add
  - K4Styles::Fonts::paintFont() helper. Zero visual change on macOS.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.17] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- Remove dead code across 16 files (-121 lines)
  - Remove unused members, empty functions, and legacy code:
  - sidetonegenerator: ToneIODevice class, legacy methods (playDit/Dah, etc.)
  - bandpopupwidget: m_row1Buttons, m_row2Buttons, focusOutEvent
  - displaypopupwidget: focusOutEvent, m_currentRefLevel
  - notificationwidget: dismissed signal, setShowErrorCode
  - radiostate: autoNotchFilter, legacy NT parser
  - vfowidget: m_inactiveColor
  - panadapter_rhi: m_peakTrailColor
  - minipan_rhi: m_smoothingAlpha
  - kpa1500client: atuPresentChanged signal
  - audioengine: unused QBuffer include
- **ui**: Replace hardcoded font sizes with K4Styles constants
  - menuoverlay.cpp: 8x font-size: 14px → FontSizePopup
  - mainwindow.cpp: 12px → FontSizeButton, 14px → FontSizePopup
  - kpa1500panel.cpp: setPointSize(10) → FontSizeMedium
  - kpa1500window.cpp: font-size: 14px → FontSizePopup
  - textdecodewindow.cpp: font-size: 14px → FontSizePopup
  - txmeterwidget.cpp: 2x setPointSize(10) → FontSizeMedium
  - minipan_rhi.cpp: font-size: 9px → FontSizeNormal
- **ui**: Consolidate stylesheet templates to K4Styles functions
  - Replace 10+ inline stylesheet templates (with 7-16 positional arguments)
  - across 6 files with 6 new centralized K4Styles functions:
  - compactButton(): Small controls (MON, NORM, BAL)
  - sidePanelButton(): Dark gradient panel buttons
  - sidePanelButtonLight(): Light gradient TX/PF buttons
  - panelButtonWithDisabled(): Panel buttons with disabled state
  - dialogButton(): Dialog action buttons
  - controlButton(bool): Decode window controls
  - Additional cleanup:
  - Rename AgcGreen → StatusGreen (semantic naming for general active state)
  - Remove unused RitCyan constant (dead code)
  - Fix vforowwidget.cpp: use VfoBGreen for VFO B square (was using AgcGreen)
  - Net change: -58 lines (329 added to K4Styles, 387 removed from 6 files)
- Comprehensive code quality improvements across 4 sections
- Standardize fonts and memory button styling
  - Consolidate to Inter font with tabular figures for all UI
  - Add K4Styles::Fonts namespace with dataFont() helper
  - Remove JetBrains Mono fonts (saves ~825KB)
  - Refactor memory buttons to use sidePanelButton styles
  - Add MemoryButtonWidth, FontSizeFrequency constants
  - Increase centerWidget width 310→330px for proper button spacing
  - Update LSMinimumSystemVersion to 15.0 for macOS Tahoe
  - Update documentation with font and button conventions
- **ui**: Replace tuning rate underline with digit color indicator
  - Change tuning rate visualization from an underline below the frequency
  - to coloring the affected digits in gray. Digits at or below the current
  - tuning rate position are grayed out, showing which digits change when
  - tuning. This eliminates alignment issues caused by font metric differences.
- Remove paddle test UI and clean up code formatting
  - Remove dit/dah paddle test indicators from CW Keyer options page
  - Remove unused IndicatorSize and IndicatorSpacing K4Styles constants
  - Clean up if/return formatting in radiostate.cpp command handlers
  - Remove paddle state change signal connections from options dialog

### Fixed

- Restore correct SIFP and TM command parsing
  - The refactoring in 4b704c3 broke radio meter parsing:
  - SIFP: Was using fixed-position integers, now correctly parses
  - "VS:" and "IS:" prefixed key-value pairs for voltage/current
  - TM: Was using 4-digit fields, now correctly uses 3-digit fields
  - (TMaaabbbcccddd format) with QRP mode power scaling
  - Fixes voltage, current, power, and SWR display in UI.
- **ui**: Use font metrics for cross-platform button text positioning
  - Replace hard-coded Y positions (18px, h-10) with QFontMetrics-based
  - calculations for DualControlButton text rendering. This fixes text
  - appearing cramped on Windows where font rendering produces taller
  - glyphs than macOS.
  - Calculate primary text baseline using font ascent + margin
  - Calculate alt text baseline using button height - descent - margin
  - Ensures consistent text positioning regardless of platform DPI or
  - font rendering differences

---

## [0.2.0-beta.16] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **vfo**: Add VFO lock indicators with padlock arc visual
  - Add LK/LK$ command parsing in RadioState for lock state tracking
  - Create VfoSquareWidget with custom painting for lock arc
  - Add lockAChanged/lockBChanged signals and setLockA/setLockB methods
  - Wire LOCK A button (SW63) and LOCK B right-click (SW151)
  - Lock indicator shows semi-circular arc above VFO square (padlock effect)
- **panadapter**: Add right-click to tune opposite VFO
  - Right-click on waterfall A tunes VFO B, right-click on waterfall B tunes VFO A.
  - Click-and-drag supported for both left and right mouse buttons.
- **ui**: Add inline frequency editor and KPA1500 floating panel
  - Inline frequency editing (FrequencyDisplayWidget):
  - Click any digit to enter edit mode at that position
  - Digits change to VFO theme color (cyan for A, green for B)
  - Type digits to replace at cursor position with auto-advance
  - Arrow keys navigate between digits
  - Enter to send frequency, Escape or click-outside to cancel
  - Uses mouse grab to detect clicks outside widget
  - KPA1500 floating panel (KPA1500Panel, KPA1500Window):
  - Custom-painted amplifier control panel (320x250px)
  - Hero FWD power meter (0-1500W) with mini REF/SWR/TEMP meters
  - MODE/ATU/ANT/TUNE/RESET buttons with amber status LEDs
  - Floating window with draggable title bar
  - Position persistence via RadioSettings
  - Auto-connects when K4 connects, not on app start
- **panadapter**: Stabilize dB scale and add mouse wheel controls
  - Increase scale overlay fonts from 8pt to 9pt for better readability
  - Skip top/bottom dBm labels for visual breathing room
  - Fix dB range to use refLevel + scale formula (not hardcoded values)
  - Add Shift+Wheel for scale adjustment (±5 dB per step)
  - Add Ctrl+Wheel for reference level adjustment (±1 dB per step)
  - Add setScale() setter to RadioState for optimistic UI updates
  - Query #SCL on connect to sync initial scale from radio

### Changed

- **ui**: Remove unused FontSizeMicro constant
- **settings**: Rename rigctld to catServer with port 9299
  - Rename the CAT passthrough server settings from rigctld to catServer
  - to avoid confusion with the unrelated Hamlib rigctld utility.
- **ui**: Centralize hardcoded styles to K4Styles constants
  - Add IndicatorSpacing constant for dit/dah paddle indicators
  - Replace hardcoded setSpacing values with Dimensions constants
  - Replace hardcoded font-size values with FontSize constants
  - Clean up optionsdialog, macrodialog, displaypopup, antennacfgpopup

### Fixed

- **kpa1500**: Prevent crash on app shutdown and simplify status labels
  - Add MainWindow destructor to disconnect KPA1500 signals before child cleanup
  - Change KPA1500Client destructor to abort socket without emitting signals
  - Remove deprecated ^OS poll command and parser
  - Simplify status bar: "K4"/"KPA1500" with color indicating connection state
- **panadapter**: Switch to UP/DN commands when dragging past edges
  - When dragging past the visible spectrum edges, emit frequencyScrolled()
  - instead of frequencyDragged(). This delegates edge handling (page turns)
  - to the K4 radio, matching wheel scroll behavior.
  - Detect x < 0 or x > width during drag
  - Emit frequencyScrolled(-1/+1) at edges with 100ms rate limiting
  - Apply same logic to right-drag for opposite VFO tuning
  - Fixes hard stop at left edge and runaway scroll at right edge

### Security

- Remove proprietary PDFs and CLAUDE.md from tracking
  - Add *.pdf and **/CLAUDE.md to .gitignore
  - Remove all PDFs from resources/ (Elecraft internal docs)
  - Remove all CLAUDE.md files (AI-generated internal docs)
  - These files contain proprietary information and must never be
  - exposed publicly. History will be rewritten to purge all traces.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.15] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **windows**: Add HID report ID byte for KPOD communication
  - Windows hidapi requires report ID (0x00) as the first byte for devices
  - without numbered reports. Without this, commands were being misinterpreted:
  - buf[0] was treated as report ID instead of command
  - Actual command data was shifted, causing zeros to be sent

---

## [0.2.0-beta.14] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- Add Display FPS and Streaming Latency settings
  - New features:
  - Display FPS menu item (12-30) in MENU overlay under APP SETTINGS
  - Streaming Latency setting (0-7) in Radio Manager dialog
  - Both settings are per-radio and persist
  - Technical changes:
  - Add synthetic menu item support (negative IDs for app-created items)
  - Query #FPS on connect, apply stored preference if different
  - Send SL command during connection initialization
  - Increase waterfall texture resolution (4096x1024) for HiDPI

### Changed

- **ui**: Replace hardcoded values with K4Styles constants
  - Replace hardcoded pixel values and colors with K4Styles::Dimensions
  - and K4Styles::Colors constants for better maintainability:
  - rxeqpopupwidget.cpp: ButtonHeightMini, PopupButtonSpacing, etc.
  - vforowwidget.cpp: FontSizeLarge for mode labels
  - mainwindow.cpp: DialogMargin for indicator height
  - textdecodewindow.cpp: ButtonHeightMedium, ButtonHeightMini, PaddingSmall
  - radiomanagerdialog.cpp: PopupContentMargin, DialogMargin, etc.
  - vfowidget.cpp: PopupButtonSpacing, BorderWidth, PaddingSmall
  - sidecontrolpanel.cpp: PaddingSmall, PopupButtonSpacing, ButtonHeightMini
  - Reduces K4Styles compliance violations from 184 to 163 (-11%).
  - Remaining violations are mostly stylesheet font-size values requiring
  - more extensive QString template refactoring.
- **dsp**: Replace Lanczos-3 with GPU bilinear interpolation
  - Simplify spectrum shader by removing custom 6-tap Lanczos kernel in favor
  - of hardware bilinear filtering. With 4096-wide textures, GPU interpolation
  - provides equivalent quality with less complexity.

### Fixed

- **ui**: Clean UI reset on disconnect, ALC meter scaling, SPAN default
  - Clear all UI state on disconnect: panadapters, minipans, VFOs, meters, menu
  - Fix waterfall artifact on disconnect by uploading zeroed buffer to GPU texture
  - Fix ALC meter scaling to use K4's 7-bar range instead of 10
  - Fix SPAN not updating from RDY by changing default from 10000 to 0
  - Fix duplicate frequency labels at narrow spans with adaptive decimal precision
- **windows**: Add retry logic for KPOD HID device open
  - Windows HID can have race conditions where the device path from
  - enumeration becomes stale before we can open it. This manifests as
  - "The system cannot find the file specified" (0x00000002) errors.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.13] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- Add application icon for macOS and Windows
  - Add K4Controller.ico for Windows (from Elecraft K4 Icon)
  - Generate K4Controller.icns for macOS from the .ico
  - Update CMakeLists.txt to include icon in macOS app bundle
  - Update Info.plist.in with CFBundleIconFile
  - Update K4Controller.rc.in with Windows icon resource

### Fixed

- **windows**: Use @ONLY syntax for icon path in RC file
  - CMake configure_file uses @VAR@ not ${VAR} with @ONLY option
- **ci**: Force link Homebrew packages after install
  - Cache may restore packages without symlinks, causing find_package to fail
- **ci**: Use qt instead of qt@6 (Homebrew formula renamed)
  - Homebrew renamed qt@6 to qt since Qt 6 is now the default version
  - Bust cache with v2 prefix to avoid stale cache issues
  - Remove unnecessary brew link commands (fresh cache will be clean)

---

## [0.2.0-beta.12] - 2026-01-16

### Debug

- **kpod**: Log all HID interfaces to find correct one on Windows
  - KPOD may expose multiple HID interfaces. Log usage_page and usage
  - for each to identify the correct vendor-defined interface.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.11] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **kpod**: Use hid_open_path() on Windows instead of hid_open()
  - On Windows, hid_open(VID, PID) can fail even when hid_enumerate()
  - finds the device. Using hid_open_path() with the path from enumeration
  - is more reliable.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.10] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **kpod**: Write debug log to TEMP directory on Windows
  - TEMP is guaranteed to exist and be writable, unlike AppDataLocation

---

## [0.2.0-beta.9] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **release**: Fix hdiutil Resource busy error in DMG creation
  - Use ditto instead of cp -R for proper macOS bundle handling
  - Add sync and small delay to ensure filesystem is flushed
  - Add .metadata_never_index to prevent Spotlight interference
  - Add -nocrossdev flag to hdiutil

---

## [0.2.0-beta.8] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **kpod**: Create log directory on Windows before writing

---

## [0.2.0-beta.7] - 2026-01-16

### Debug

- **kpod**: Add detailed Windows logging for HID troubleshooting
  - Write debug log to AppData/Local/K4Controller/kpod_debug.log on Windows
  - Log all hid_write/hid_read results and errors
  - Increase read timeout to 500ms on Windows
  - Helps diagnose KPOD detection issues on Windows 10/11

---

## [0.2.0-beta.6] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- **macos**: Switch release from ZIP to signed DMG, update bundle ID
  - Change bundle identifier from com.elecraft.k4controller to com.ai5qk.k4controller
  - Replace ZIP distribution with signed/notarized DMG
  - DMG includes Applications symlink for drag-to-install UX
  - Should resolve quarantine/TCC issues blocking network access on first launch

---

## [0.2.0-beta.5] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- **macos**: Add NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription for network permission prompt
  - macOS 14+ requires this Info.plist key to show the local network
  - permission dialog. Without it, connections to local network devices
  - (like the K4 radio) are silently blocked.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.4] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **ui**: Meter improvements, DX Cluster tab, menu cleanup
  - Add 500ms peak hold time to TX meters before decay starts
  - Color S-meter +dB labels (20, 40, 60) red using TxRed
  - Add numeric labels (1, 3, 5, 7) to ALC meter scale
  - Make tuning rate indicator thicker (2px → 4px)
  - Remove redundant Connect > Radios menu (use globe button)
  - Add DX Cluster tab to Preferences dialog (placeholder)

### Fixed

- **audio**: Lower default mic gain from 50% to 25%
  - macOS mic input is typically hot, causing ALC overload at unity gain.
  - New default provides -6dB headroom out of the gate.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- **macos**: Add entitlements for microphone, network, USB, serial
  - Hardened runtime requires explicit entitlements for:
  - Network client access (K4 TCP connection)
  - Microphone input (TX audio)
  - Audio output (RX audio)
  - USB device access (KPOD)
  - Serial port access (HaliKey)
  - Without entitlements, macOS silently denies access with no permission prompt.

---

## [0.2.0-beta.2] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **dsp**: Dual panadapter, Mini-Pan improvements, and passband cleanup
  - Fix dual panadapter frequency offset (spectrum was showing only partial range)
  - Fix Mini-Pan VFO B routing (discovered undocumented RX byte at position 4)
  - Add Mini-Pan color scheme: blue for A, green for B (matching main panadapter)
  - Add center frequency marker line to Mini-Pan
  - Remove passband edge lines for cleaner display (keep fill + center marker)
  - Add setPassbandColor() to MiniPanWidget for customizable passband colors
  - 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- **ui**: Display popup controls, ref/span A/B support, and right panel expansion
  - Display Popup Menu:
  - AVERAGE control group with +/- buttons (cycles 1, 5, 10, 15, 20)
  - DDC NB control group showing mode (OFF/ON/AUTO) and level (0-14)
  - Fixed Tune mode cycling through all 6 states (SLIDE1-TRACK)
  - VFO cursor mode toggling (A+/A-/A AUTO/A HIDE)
  - Waterfall color cycling (5 colors)
  - Peak mode and Freeze toggles via right-click
  - LCD/EXT target selection for display commands
  - All buttons now send CAT commands to K4
  - Ref Level & Span A/B Support:

  - Add libdbus-1.3.dylib (needed by QtDBus)
  - Fix permissions with chmod -R u+rw
  - Use install_name_tool to rewrite library paths to @rpath
  - 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- **ui**: DualControlButton click behavior and scroll signal wiring
  - First click on inactive button now only activates it (shows indicator)
  - Subsequent clicks swap primary/alternate labels
  - Added swapped() signal for tracking actual label swaps
  - Connected all 14 scroll signals to CAT commands in MainWindow:
  - WPM→KS, PTCH→CW, MIC→MG, CMP→CP, PWR→PC, DLY→SD,
  - BW→BW, HI→BW, SHFT→IS, LO→IS, M.RF→RG, M.SQL→SQ, S.RF→RG$, S.SQL→SQ$
  - 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- **ui**: Scroll values continue changing and button faces update
  - The K4 radio doesn't echo setting commands (KS, BW, PC, etc.), so we
  - now use optimistic updates: after sending CAT, immediately update
  - RadioState so the next scroll uses the correct value and button
  - faces update via signals.
- **ui**: RF Gain format and Power QRP/QRO transitions
  - RF Gain:
  - Fixed command format to RG-nn; and RG$-nn; (with minus sign)
  - Range corrected to 0-60 (was incorrectly 0-100)
  - Button faces display with minus sign (e.g., "-0", "-30")
- **build**: Remove test executables from CMakeLists.txt
  - Test files are local-only and not tracked in git.
  - This was causing GitHub Actions builds to fail.
- **ci**: Add qtshadertools module to Windows build
  - Required for qt6_add_shaders() used by panadapter shaders.
- **dsp**: Correct click-to-frequency coordinate mapping
  - Fixed xToFreq to use (w-1) divisor for accurate edge mapping
  - Fixed freqToNormalized usages to multiply by (w-1) for consistency
  - Click at x=0 now correctly maps to start frequency

  - Passband, marker, and notch overlays now align with click positions
  - Also makes GuiPrivate optional on Windows for CI compatibility.
- **dsp**: Adjust coordinate mapping and fix Windows CI
  - Revert xToFreq to use w divisor (matches spectrum rendering coordinates)
  - Revert freqToNormalized multiplier to use w (consistent with spectrum)
  - Move Qt private headers inside #ifdef Q_OS_MACOS to fix Windows build
  - Private headers only needed for macOS Metal RHI capability check
- **protocol**: Correct PAN payload byte offsets per K4-Remote Protocol doc
  - The PAN payload structure was being parsed with incorrect byte offsets:
  - RX receiver: was byte 4, corrected to byte 1
  - Center Frequency: was bytes 11-18, corrected to bytes 8-15
  - Sample Rate: was bytes 19-22, corrected to bytes 16-19
  - Noise Floor: was bytes 23-26, corrected to bytes 20-23
  - PAN Data: was bytes 27+, corrected to bytes 24+
  - This fixes the ~470 Hz frequency alignment offset between the spectrum
  - display and VFO marker/click positions.
- **dsp**: Correct IF shift passband positioning
  - K4 reports IF shift in decahertz (10 Hz units), not as 0-99 index.
  - Changed calculation from (m_ifShift - 50) * 42 to m_ifShift * 10.
  - USB/DATA: passband center = dial + shiftOffsetHz
  - LSB: passband center = dial - shiftOffsetHz
  - CW/CW-R: passband centered at dial + pitch offset
  - AM/FM: passband centered at dial + shiftOffsetHz

- **dsp**: Correct spectrum dBm calibration using per-packet noise floor
  - The spectrum display was showing signals ~19 dB lower than the K4's
  - actual display (e.g., -89 dBm instead of -70 dBm).
  - Root cause: decompressBins() used a hardcoded -160 offset, but the K4
  - sends the actual noise floor value in each PAN packet header. This
  - noise floor varies and should be used for correct dBm calibration.
- **dsp**: Calibrate spectrum dBm values to match K4 display
  - Adjust decompression offset from -160 to -146 (calibrated via
  - comparison with K4 spectrum peaks)
  - Simplify dB range calculation: minDb=refLevel, maxDb=refLevel+scale
  - Removes complex scaleFactor calculation in favor of direct mapping
  - The display range now correctly tracks K4's ref level and scale
  - settings, with signal levels matching the physical radio display.

- **dsp**: Correct notch filter positioning in panadapter and mini pan
  - For CW/CW-R modes, the notch offset is now calculated relative to the
  - passband center (notchPitch - cwPitch) instead of using the raw notch
  - pitch. This ensures the notch aligns correctly with the passband in
  - both displays regardless of tunedFreq/centerFreq mismatch.

  - Change cycle: STATIC → SLIDE2 → TRACK → FIXED1 → FIXED2 → SLIDE1
  - Use optimized CAT commands (#FXA3, #FXA4, #FXA0;#FXT0, #FXT1, #FXA1, #FXA2)
  - Add optimistic local update since K4 doesn't echo #FXT/#FXA commands
- **ci**: Add qtserialport to Windows Qt modules
  - HaliKey serial port support requires QtSerialPort module.

### Revert

- **protocol**: Restore working PAN payload byte offsets
  - The K4-Remote Protocol Rev. A1 document shows different byte offsets
  - than what the actual K4 firmware sends. Reverting to the original
  - working structure.
  - The frequency alignment issue needs to be investigated separately -
  - the actual payload structure differs from the documentation.
